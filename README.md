**NOTE**
This was the first time I've ever made some kind of AI, so the AI in this game is pretty dumb.
However, I've had a lot of fun making it and am pretty pleased with the results.

Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to code the actual theme in. The goal was to remove the last rows on both ends every ~2 turns.
